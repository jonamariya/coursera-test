        <div id="m1" class="menu-tile"><h3>Chicken</h3><p>Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[17] When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. </p></div>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <div id="m2" class="menu-tile"><h3>Beef</h3><p>The word beef is from the Latin bos, in contrast to cow which is from Middle English cou (both words have the same Indo-European root ).[6] After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking nobles who ruled England naturally used French words to refer to the meats they were served. Thus, various Anglo-Saxon words were used for the animal (such as nēat, or cu for adult females) by the peasants, but the meat was called boef (ox) (Modern French ) by the French nobles — who did not often deal with the live animal — when it was served to them. ]</p></div>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
         <div id="m3" class="menu-tile"><h3>Sushi</h3><p>The original type of sushi, known today as nare-zushi  was first made in Southeast Asia. Fish was salted and wrapped in fermented rice, a traditional lacto-fermented rice dish. Narezushi was made of this gutted fish which was stored in fermented rice for months at a time for preservation. The fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling.The fermented rice was discarded and fish was the only part consumed. This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for the Japanese.</p></div>
